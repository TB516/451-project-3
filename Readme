Im on a linux PC so I dont have Visual Studio, but I do have VSCdoe, so I made this a devcontainer, then used the GNU assembly. To run yourself if you arent on a Linux device, using VSCode devcontainers should let it all work. 

To run, the VSCode debugger can be used, as it will build the executable, then prompt for inputs to demo the first and second parts. Otherwise, you can use `make` to build the output, and then call the program with 3 parameters (fist = first num to add and multiply for the demo, second = second number to add and multiply for the demo, third = factor to multiple the part 3 array elements by). Once the add and multiply demo is done, then the part 3 demo will run, where it will take an array and multiply it by the factor param.
